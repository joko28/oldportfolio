      <div id="bio">Hi, my name is Jozey Nguyen and I go to San Jose State University! My major is Digital Media Arts and my minor is Architectural Studies.
        <br><br>
      I have always loved the arts since I was a little girl. I would draw and take photos with any camera I can get my hands on. In the 8th grade of middle school, I took a yearbook class because I wanted to be involved in the school spirit. I did not have much experience with a digital camera, for yearbook I used my father's Nikon camera. The experience of using that camera and making memories with my friends and teachers was fun for me. I was not an amazing professional at drawing or doing art, but I was good. Going into college, I wanted to regain that experience and make magic with my hands, so I chose Digital Media Arts. This major would help me get back into the arts and help me improve on what I love to do.
        <br><br>
      Choosing architectural studies as my minor is another aspiration that I enjoy. I love building, using my hands to build or to create something because it's a way for me to acknoledge myself that I have done something. Building is fun and keeps me going, I build until I finish. My dream has always been to build my own house one day, whether it be planning, constuction, or figuring out what I wanted in my home, because I want to leave a legacy of myself in the ground. I motivate myself to do better and keep going even if things get challenging, because I know in the end, my hard work has paid off.
